        <h2>Tank Maintenance</h2>
        <article>
            <strong>PH Balance</strong>
            <p>Most freshwater aquarium tropical fish do best at a pH of 6.8 to 7.6, although certain fish may require higher or lower levels. 
                The pH of an aquarium tends to drop over time due to the breakdown of organic material, and the best way to prevent this 
                is through regular partial water changes.</p>
        </article>
        <article>
            <strong>Algae Contol</strong>
            <p>If you see algae beginning to grow on the glass, rocks, or other hard surfaces of the tank, remove it. Scrape the glass, remove rocks, 
                and scrub them. Vacuum the gravel when you perform water changes. Keep live plants: Live plants will absorb many of the nutrients 
                that algae thrive upon.</p>
        </article>
        <article>
            <strong>Water Temperature</strong>
            <p>A good range is 76° to 80°F (25° to 27°C). A few species need to be kept several degrees warmer, and some species require temperatures 
                a few degrees cooler. A thermometer is vital. A stick-on type enables you to check the temperature whenever you look at the aquarium.</p>

            <strong>Fish Diseases</strong>
            <p>Fin rot is a common disease that describes the rotting or fraying of a fish’s fins or tail. If you suspect that your fish may be 
                suffering from fin rot, take a close look at their fins and tail.Fin rot is most often caused by a dirty tank and poor water 
                quality, poor care, or exposure to other fish who may have contagious diseases.</p>
        </article>
        <article>
            <strong>Feeding Times</strong>
            <p>In nature, most fish feed in the early morning and at dusk. Exceptions are herbivores and omnivores that forage 
                throughout the day, and nocturnal species. Although aquarium fish can be fed at any time of day, morning and evening 
                feedings are best.</p>

            <strong>Aquarium Lighting</strong>
            <p>Your best lighting options for freshwater tanks are standard fluorescent bulbs, compact fluorescent bulbs, metal 
                halide lights, and LED lights. You want to avoid incandescent bulbs as they are suitable only for small aquariums 
                and give off too much heat.</p>

            <strong>Necessary Decorations</strong>
            <p>Highly-active fish have a considerably higher oxygen uptake than more dormant breeds. If you’re keeping such fish, 
                oxygen-producing decorations like bubble chests and and underwater rivers and bridges can help to provide plenty them 
                with of air, keeping your fish healthy and allowing them to remain active.</p>
